# Challange-Game

The main purpose of this game is to see what's the difference between using jquery and using only javascript.

## How does this game work?

The game will start from level 1, which means the game will indicates on which button to press (just like simon says). Then the player should imitate the button presses or you will loose. By every round finished successfully, you'll go into the next level with an extra button to press. (ex: on level 1 you have to press 1 button, on level 2, 2 buttons and it goes on sequentially till you loose)
